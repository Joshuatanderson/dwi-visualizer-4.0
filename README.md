# dwi-visualizer-4.0
now with a heatmap (3.0 shows cluster markers)

This project visualizes DWI incidents going back to 2011, using the BR open data portal.  
(Around 6,500 incidents have clean data, about 1,500 had to be discarded due to a lack of geocoordinates)

It is built with vanilla JS, the Google Maps API (3.0), and the Google Maps visualization library.
